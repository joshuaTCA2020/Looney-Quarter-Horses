 <p>Lee and Brenda Looney started showing horses together upon their marriage in 2001. After taking time off from showing due<br>family obligations including raising their son Jay Looney, they decided to form Looney Quarter Horses, LLC in 2010 with the<br>goal of breeding top quality western pleasure and hunseat horses with futurities in mind.  Through the years they have raised<br>World Champion Western Pleasure horses as well as many top ten horses in the nation.  Located on the outskirts of Jackson, TN,<br>visitors are always welcome to stop by and see the horses that are available for sale.</p>
